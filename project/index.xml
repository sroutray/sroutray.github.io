However, a majority of results are established for the Euclidean norm due to its special self-dual nature. In this project, we propose Generalized Conceptual Dual Implicit Accelerated Gradient Descent (GC-DIAG) which is adapted from the Conceptual Dual Implicit Accelerated Gradient (C-DIAG) [
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01543" target="_blank">1&lt;/a>
] for solving smooth minimax optimization problems $ \min_\mathbf{x}\max_\mathbf{y} g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ where $ g(.,.)$ is smooth and $g(\mathbf{x},.) $ is concave for each $\mathbf{x}$ . We prove $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ convergence rate for the primal dual gap using a potential-function based proof and Bregman Divergence framework. We also prove $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^4})$ convergence rate using Nesterov&amp;rsquo;s accelerated gradient descent and a restarting strategy, similar to [
&lt;a href="https://yenhuanli.github.io/blog/2017/05/05/mirror-descent-str/" target="_blank">2&lt;/a>
], which is an improvement over $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k})$ for smooth and strongly convex functions with respect to an arbitrary norm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resource Allocation in OFDMA Systems Using Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://sroutray.github.io/project/ofdma-rl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sroutray.github.io/project/ofdma-rl/</guid><description>&lt;p>Long Term Evolution (LTE) makes use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) to achieve high downlink data rates. Based on channel conditions of users, a resource scheduler can use dynamic resource allocation to provide best resource to users and optimize system performance. Proportional Fair (PF) scheduling is a popular resource allocation algorithm that tries to maximize total throughput while providing all users at least a minimal level of service. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) has encouraged efforts to formulate resource allocation as a RL problem. In this study, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient technique of RL is used to design RL-based resource scheduler and its performance is compared with that of the PF scheduler.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
