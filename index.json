Some of the problems that interest me are - learning actionable representations from scene images, understanding scenes at different levels of abstraction (from pixel level up to the image level) and the hierarchical relationships among them, and the challenges in working with 3D scenes. I am also interested in self-supervised approaches that jointly consider synthesis and discriminative tasks.\nI graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in May 2021, majoring in Electrical Engineering with minors in Machine Learning.

The organizers propose three subtasks - first, selecting between two sentences, the one which is against common sense. Second, identifying the most crucial reason why a statement does not make sense. Third, generating novel reasons for explaining the against common sense statement. Out of the three subtasks, this paper reports the system description of subtask A and subtask B. This paper proposes a model based on transformer neural network architecture for addressing the subtasks. The novelty in work lies in the architecture design, which handles the logical implication of contradicting statements and simultaneous information extraction from both sentences. We use a parallel instance of transformers, which is responsible for a boost in the performance. We achieved an accuracy of 94.8% in subtask A and 89% in subtask B on the test set.","tags":[],"title":"CS-NET at SemEval-2020 Task 4: Siamese BERT for ComVE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nitish Deshpande","Sandeep Routray","Abhishek Gupta"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"051740670aa3d6a5c8e403eb6337de42","permalink":"https://sroutray.github.io/publication/spectral-eff-hetnet/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spectral-eff-hetnet/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we consider a realistic K tier heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) consisting of two types of coexisting tiers - Poisson cluster process (PCP) based tiers with base-stations (BSs) and users (UE) distributed as PCP and are coupled, and Poisson point process (PPP) based tier with BSs and UEs distributed as mutually-independent PPPs. We derive the spectral efficiency (SE) for a typical user belonging to one of the tier under max-power association and open access.
