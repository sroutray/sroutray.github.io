    abstract={In this paper, we consider a realistic K tier heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) consisting of two types of coexisting tiers: Poisson cluster process (PCP) based tiers with base-stations (BSs) and users (UE) distributed as PCP and are coupled, and Poisson point process (PPP) based tier with BSs and UEs distributed as mutually-independent PPPs. We derive the spectral efficiency (SE) for a typical user belonging to one of the tier under max-power association and open access. An important intermediate step involves deriving expressions for the Laplace transforms (LT) of total received power and interference which also opens new avenues for computation of other performance metrics. We also investigate the impact of clustering over the performance of both type of users via numerical simulation and provide important design insights.},
